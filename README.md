Preliminary aspects of a future R package for creating synthetic populations.
The functions in this repository were written by Glen Weisner and Matthew Hamilton as part of a private R package repository used to implement a study to create a synthetic representation of Australian households. This public repository includes selected and edited components of that private R package which will be edited and added to as part of the process of developing a publicly released R package.
